# Design-and-Control-of-an-Omnidirectional-Mobile-Robot-Using-ROS2
🚀 Overview
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and control of an omnidirectional mobile robot using ROS2 and Arduino. The robot is equipped with Mecanum wheels, allowing for smooth omnidirectional movement. It is implemented using ROS2 nodes, Gazebo simulation, and real-time joystick control.

The goal is to create a modular, efficient, and scalable robotic system that can navigate in all directions while maintaining precise control over movement and speed.

✨ Features
✔️ Omnidirectional Motion using Mecanum wheels
✔️ ROS2-Based Control Architecture
✔️ Joystick Integration for Manual Control
✔️ Gazebo Simulation for Virtual Testing
✔️ Real-Time Motor Speed Calculation
✔️ Arduino-Based Motor Actuation & Feedback
